    <h3>You now have everything you need to build your robot</h3>
    <img src=".\images\Components.PNG" alt="photograph of all components as listed below" width="500px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <br>

    <h5>Component list</h5>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>Selection of wires</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Soldered power board</strong> (from Session 2)</li>
      <li><strong>Two wheels</strong> (to fit the motors)</li>
      <li><strong>Two motors with red and black wires attached</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Battery pack</strong> (to fit a 9V battery)</li>
      <li><strong>Connector for the micro:bit (and your micro:bit, to use with code from Session 1)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Two holders for distance sensors</strong> (after testing that your robot can move, you will add in the sensors)</li>
      <li><strong>Laser cut robot base</strong> (from Session 3)</li>  
      <li><strong>Castor wheel</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Motor driver board</strong> (to translate between the micro:bit and the motors)</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h5>Assembly</h5>
    <p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jZkq7TzWBNkAQCsPxrrvPTLQW2y8WHEqpLvqi-HaQyc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">instructions here</a> to assemble your robot.</p>    
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="code" class="left">
    <h3>Testing your motors</h3>
    <p>If you have wired up the motors according to the instructions, the test code should:</p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>Turn both motors in the forward direction</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Turn both motors in the backward direction</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Turn one motor forwards and the other backwards, so that the robot spins left</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Turn one motor forwards and the other backwards, so that the robot spins right</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Download the <a href=".\examples\Robot-Test-Code.hex" download>test code</a>, open it using the <a href="https://python.microbit.org/v/3" target="_blank">online Python editor</a>, and put the code onto your micro:bit.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Press A on your micro:bit to run the code.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Does your robot move as described in the list above?</strong></p>
    <p>If yes, your robot does not need troubleshooting, and you can <a href="#driving">move on to the next section</a>!</p>
    <p><strong>If it is not moving as described, look for your problem here.</strong></p>
    <br>

    <h5>My robot isn't moving at all!</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Check that the robot is on.</li>
      <li>Send the code to the micro:bit again, and make sure no errors show up.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If this doesn't help, ask a workshop leader to help you.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Only one of my motors is turning!</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Check for loose wires - has anything come off?</li>
      <li>Check the wires on the micro:bit connector - are they definitely in pins 12-15?</li>
      <li>Make sure that the micro:bit is pushed very firmly into its connector.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If this doesn't help, ask a workshop leader to help you.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>One or both of my motors will not stop turning!</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Check the wires on the micro:bit connector - are they definitely in pins 12-15?</li>
      <li>Make sure that the micro:bit is pushed very firmly into its connector.</li>
      <li>Send the code to the micro:bit again, and make sure no errors show up.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If this doesn't help, ask a workshop leader to help you.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>One of my motors is turning the wrong direction!
      <br><em>(it spins when it should go forward, and goes forward when it should spin)</em></h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Check the wires between the motor driver and the micro:bit connector. Check the instructions, and make sure that they all go to the right place.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If this doesn't help, ask a workshop leader to help you.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Both of my motors are turning the wrong direction!
      <br><em>(it goes backwards when it should go forward, and turns left when it should turn right)</em></h5>
    <p>This can be changed either by moving the wires, or by changing the code.</p>
    <p>Ask a workshop leader for help with this.</p>

  <div id="driving" class="left">
    <h3>Test driving</h3>
    <p>Now that you know your robot works, test out its capabilities by driving it in different directions at different speeds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do any of the wires catch on the ground while it is driving? Tape them out of the way if so.</li>
      <li>Does it tip over when speeding up? Could you move the motors or the castor wheel to make it more stable?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p>Work on your robot's motor code so that you can use the best values in the sensor code next time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the minimum speed that still allows the motors to turn?</li>
      <li>What values give a good full or quarter turn in each direction?</li>
      <li>Is one wheel slower than the other? Can you edit your code to make it more consistant?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Save your code so that you can carry on next time.</strong></p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="your-code" class="left">
    <h3>Your robot code</h3>
    <p>Congratulations, your robot works!</p>
    <p>In Session 5, we will add the sensors and test your robot code, so that it can use the distance sensors to decide how to move.</p>
    <p>You can choose to either...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go back to the <a href="session1.html" target="_blank">Session 1</a> instructions, and use them to edit the code you have used today to set up the distance sensing algorithm.</li>
      <li>Get your code from Session 1 (a link was emailed to you, or speak to a workshop leader), and edit the motor speeds based on today's testing.</li>
    </ul>
