    <h1>Optional Work 2: wiring diagrams</h1>
    <p>If you would like to achieve a Silver CREST Award, the suggestions below will help you to extend your robot project.</p>
    <p>Remember to save copies of your work and/or take photographs, to use in your final report.</p>

    <h3>soldering</h3>
    <p>If you have soldering equipment at home, at school, or in an after-school club, you can practice with other kits.</p>
    <p>Let us know if this applies to you, and we will give you another practice kit to work on.</p>
    <p><a href="https://isioviel.github.io/tutorials-soldering.html#components" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a guide to identifying components and where to place them on a new PCB.</p>

  <div id="ultrasonic" class="left">
    <h3>wiring an ultrasonic sensor</h3>
    <p>...description of how these are connected...</p>
    <p>...photograph of how these are connected...</p>
    <p>...drawing of how these are connected...</p>
    <p>...draw your own circuit diagram for two ultrasonic distance sensors...</p>

  <div id="extras" class="left">
    <h3>other components for your robot</h3>
    <p>In the future, once your robot is built and programmed, you might want to add extra things to it.</p>
    <img src="./images/components-various.jpg" alt="selection of components that could be connected to a robot: LED screen, IR sensor, RTC, servo motor, neopixel strip, seven-segment display, microswitch" width="400px" height="auto">
    <p>Some examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Servo motors</li>
      <li>LEDs</li>
      <li>Neopixels</li>
      <li>Infrared line following sensors</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Research some of these components, or any others you have heard about.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do they do?</li>
      <li>How could they improve your robot?</li>
      <li>What voltage do they need to work properly?</li>
      <li>Has anyone connected them to a micro:bit before? Do they have any advice on how to connect it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pick your favourite component, and draw a circuit diagram of how to connect it to your robot.</p>
    <p><strong>If you bring your research to the next club session and discuss it with us, we might be able to give you what you need to add it your robot.</strong></p>
