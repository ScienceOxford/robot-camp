    <h1>Optional Work 3: more design work</h1>
    <p>If you would like to achieve a Silver CREST Award, the suggestions below will help you to extend your robot project.</p>
    <p>Remember to save copies of your work and/or take photographs, to use in your final report.</p>

    <h3>3D printing</h3>
    <p>You can use your Tinkercad account to design extra parts for your robot to be 3D printed.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Guidelines</h5>
    <p>Please consider the following things when designing your parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the pieces small, approximately the volume of a 5cm cube.</li>
      <li>3D printers cannot print in mid-air, so avoid over-hanging parts in your designs.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If you have a part ready to print, please send us an email with the following information:</p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>The name of your design</strong> (so we can find it on Tinkercad)</li>
      <li><strong>What the part is for</strong> (if we have lots of parts to print, we will focus on the ones that are necessary for your robot project)</li>
      <li><strong>Why did you choose to 3D print this design instead of using another tool?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Which colour you would like it printed in</strong> (we do not have every colour, so suggest a couple of back-up colours as well).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If we cannot print your file for any reason, we will let you know what the problem is.</p>
    <br>

  <div id="2D" class="left">
    <h3>Laser cutting</h3>
    <p>You can use your Tinkercad account to design extra parts for your robot to be laser cut.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Guidelines</h5>
    <p>Please consider the following things when designing your parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the pieces small, no bigger than an A5 sheet of paper.</li>
      <li>Laser cutters can only cut flat things, so make sure your design is not 3D.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If you have a part ready to cut, please send us an email with the following information:</p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>The name of your design</strong> (so we can find it on Tinkercad)</li>
      <li><strong>What the part is for</strong> (if we have lots of parts to cut, we will focus on the ones that are necessary for your robot project)</li>
      <li><strong>Why did you choose to laser cut this design instead of using another tool?</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If we cannot cut your file for any reason, we will let you know what the problem is.</p>

    <h3>Alternative CAD software</h3>
    <p>Tinkercad isn't the only software available for design work. Other software can be challenging to learn, but will allow you to design more complicated things in the future.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of free software you might like to investigate (but there are lots of others as well!). To try them out,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download or create an account</li>
      <li>See if they have tutorials, or look on YouTube for some help</li>
      <li>Experiment and see what you can create. One suggestion is to replicate something you have already made in Tinkercad - how is the new software different?</li>
      <li>Do not expect to make something perfect on your first go, it will take a lot of practice!</li>
    </ol>
