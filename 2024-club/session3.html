    <h3>3D printing vs laser cutting</h3>
    <h5>3D printer</h5>
    <img scr=".\images\3d-printer.gif" alt="timelapse of a 3D printer printing a design layer by layer in yellow plastic" width="400px" height="auto">
    <p>A 3D printer works by melting plastic and <em>extruding</em> it through a nozzle. It builds up a design layer by layer, melting each layer onto the one underneath, creating a solid object.</p>
    <p>It is slow, but can create complicated shapes.</p>

    <br>

    <h5>Laser cutter</h5>
    <img src=".\images\laser-cutter.gif" alt="animated image showing an xTool laser cutter engraving the words laser cut onto a piece of wood, and then scoring a design" width="400px" height="auto">
    <p>A laser cutter starts with a flat piece of material, such as wood or cardboard, and 'draws' on it with a laser. The laser burns when it draws, and can either cut all the way through, or mark on the surface.</p>
    <p>It is fast, and is perfect for creating flat objects.</p>

    <br>

    <h5>Choosing the right tool for the job</h5>
    <p>A laser cutter is faster than a 3D printer, and we can cut out of wood or cardboard, which is more environmentally friendly than using plastic.</p>
    <p>A 3D printer can create very complicated objects, and can make them very strong.</p>
    <p>When deciding which tool to use, you must think about the end goal - what properties does your object need to have?</p>

The back is plain and has a badge glued onto it; the front has the words 'Science Oxford' and two star designs raised. On the right, front and back of a wooden laser cut shape. The back has a mirror of the word 'cut' cut out of it; the front has the word 'cut' cut out of it, the word 'score' burned as an outline, and the word 'engrave' burned and shaded in" width="400px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>For your robot bases, we will be using the laser cutter because:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You only need a flat base to attach your parts to - making it 3D is not necessary.</li>
      <li>It is fast, so if your first design doesn't work properly, we can easily cut a new one.</li>
      <li>Wood is better for the environment than plastic.</li>
      <li>Wood is easy to modify with hand tools - if you need more holes, we can add them in without needing to remake the whole object.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tinkercad</h3>
    <p>For this workshop, we will use the online software <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a>.</p>
    <p>To access the practice files, you will be given a Classroom link and a nickname.</p>
    <p><em>If you already have a Tinkercad account and would like to use it, join the Classroom with your log-in instead of with the nickname.<br><strong>It is important that you use the Classroom, so that we can find your designs to print and cut after the workshop.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Practice #1 - design for 3D printing</h3>
    <p>During the workshop, we will show you how to use Tinkercad to create a small shape suitable for 3D printing.</p>

    <br>
    <p>For this practice, you must work on the example badge base, so that everyone's design is the same size and can be printed quickly.</p>
    <p>Add shapes or text onto it to create a design of your choice - keep it small and quick!</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will 3D print your creation in <strong>white plastic</strong>. You can collect it next session and decorate it if you wish.</p>

    <h3>Practice #2 - design for laser cutting</h3>
    <p>During the workshop, we will show you how to use Tinkercad to create a small shape suitable for laser cutting.</p>
    <p>To designing a flat shape in Tinkercad, you need to think a bit differently. For a recap of what we discussed, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Designing-in-Tinkercad-for-a-Laser-Cutter/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For this practice, you must work on the example keyring base, so that everyone's design is the same size and can be cut quickly.</p>
    <p>Add shapes and text onto it as holes, to create a design of your choice - keep it small and quick!</p>
    <p>Add a note to your design to let us know which parts of your design should be <strong>cut, scored, engraved</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will laser cut your creation in <strong>wood</strong>. You can collect it next session and decorate it if you wish.</p>

  <div id="robot" class="left">
    <h3>Design your robot's base</h3>
    <p>In the Tinkercad Classroom, we have given you four different designs to start with. You can also start from a blank Workplane to make your own outline.</p>
    <h5>Design rules</h5>
    <p><strong>Your robot base design must:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fit onto an A4 sheet</li>
      <li>Be large enough to fit all of your parts on to</li>
      <li>Have some holes for wires</li>
      <li>Have space for the wheels, so they will not catch</li>
      <li>Be recognisably yours (e.g. add a name or initials)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Your robot base design can:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be made of multiple parts (if they all fit onto an A4 sheet)</li>
      <li>Have holes for bolts or screws</li>
      <li>Be completed at home, if you send us your file <strong>before the deadline</strong></li>
    </ul>
