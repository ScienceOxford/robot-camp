    <h3>3D printing vs laser cutting</h3>
    <p>... how each tool works ...</p>
    <p>... videos of them in action ...</p>
    <p>... deciding which is the most suitable tool for a job...</p>
    <p>... difference in designing for each tool ...</p>

    <h3>Practice #1 - design for 3D printing</h3>
    <p>... using Tinkercad ...</p>
    <p>... link to tutorials (I will live-demo during the session) ...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>... changing size of a shape ...</li>
      <li>... moving and aligning a shape ...</li>
      <li>... looking around the workspace, checking your shape ...</li>
      <li>... grouping your final creation ...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>... work on the example base (so that everyone's design is about the same size and can be printed quickly) add shapes / words onto it to create a design of your choice ...</p>
    <p>... make something small and quick! ...</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will 3D print your creation in <strong>white plastic</strong>. You can collect it next session and decorate it if you wish.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We will laser cut your creation in <strong>wood</strong>. You can collect it next session and decorate it if you wish.</p>

  <div id="robot" class="left">
    <h3>Design your robot's base</h3>
    <p>... A4 sheet of wood, your design must be smaller than / all fit onto this sheet - you might not want to use all of it ...</p>
    <p>... all the parts that need to fit onto it ...</p>
    <p>... show some examples ...</p>
    <p>... there are four different example bases you can use as a start point OR you can start from scratch ...</p>
    <br>
    <p>... finish at least the outline by the end of the session, so we have something to cut for you ...</p>
    <p>... if you would like to add more to your design at home, take the card with your log-in information, and you MUST SEND ME THE FINISHED BASE BY THE DEADLINE - if you send it me after this date it will be too late, and you will need to use one of the example bases instead ...</p>
